## üß† About the CEH v13 Exams

The **Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) v13** certification by EC-Council is a globally recognized credential that validates skills in ethical hacking techniques, now enhanced with AI-driven methodologies. It covers domains like reconnaissance, scanning, enumeration, system hacking, web application testing, and AI-based attack and defense strategies.

- **CEH Theory Exam (312-50)**: A 4-hour, 125-question multiple-choice exam covering 20 modules, including footprinting, network scanning, malware threats, cryptography, and AI-driven cyberattacks. It tests theoretical knowledge of ethical hacking methodologies.
- **CEH Practical Exam**: A 6-hour, hands-on exam with 20 real-world challenges in a lab environment. Candidates must demonstrate practical skills using tools like Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, and AI-based tools to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.

### CEH v13 AI-Enhanced Topics
CEH v13 introduces AI-driven techniques, reflecting their growing role in cyberattacks and defenses. Key AI-related topics include:
- **AI in Attack Automation**: How attackers use AI for reconnaissance, social engineering, malware generation, and vulnerability exploitation.
- **AI in Defense**: Leveraging AI for threat detection, anomaly analysis, and automated incident response.
- **AI-Powered Tools**: Familiarity with tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or custom scripts for AI-driven security tasks.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Understanding the ethical implications of AI in cybersecurity, including bias in AI models and responsible use.
